    Everything feeding it — simulated pressure, the nib angle, the per-stroke
    pulse — is sampled per point and each carries a little noise. A width that
    steps about from one sample to the next puts every one of those steps on
    the outline as a lump, so the profile is blurred along the stroke before
    any geometry is built from it. It's a blur along the line, not across it:
    the shape of the stroke is untouched, only how fast its width may change.

    Done before the tapers, not after. A taper is already a smooth ramp and
    needs no help — but it's anchored to the ends of the stroke, and the far
    end moves while the line is being drawn. Blur across it and the head of a
    short stroke starts averaging in values that are still changing, so the
    beginning of the mark creeps as the stroke gets longer.
