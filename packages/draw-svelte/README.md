# draw-svelte

The native Svelte 5 port of Drawesome: seven pens that behave like pens, an eraser that takes away area rather than whole strokes, and SVG or PNG out. It matches the React package’s tools, layout, defaults, interactions, themes, and export format.

## Install

```bash
npm install draw-svelte
```

Peer dependency: `svelte >=5`.

## Quick start

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { Draw } from "draw-svelte";
  import "draw-svelte/styles.css";
</script>

<div style="height: 480px">
  <Draw />
</div>
```

`Draw` fills its parent container, so give the wrapper a height.

## Props

The Svelte component accepts the same drawing, tool, chrome, placement, theme, and customization props as the React `Draw` component. Native Svelte attributes are also supported: use `class` (or the compatibility alias `className`) and pass inline styles as a string.

```svelte
<Draw
  placement="left"
  tools={["pencil", "pen", "marker", "highlighter", "brush"]}
  controls={{ undo: false, clear: false, opacity: false }}
  background="checker"
/>
```

## Imperative handle

Bind the component instance to use the same export methods:

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { Draw } from "draw-svelte";

  let draw: Draw;
</script>

<Draw bind:this={draw} />
<button onclick={() => draw.download("sketch", "png", 2)}>
  Download PNG
</button>
```

The exposed methods are `toSvg`, `toPng`, `download`, `getStrokes`, `setStrokes`, `undo`, `redo`, `clear`, and `getSize`.

## Composing the pieces

`DrawSurface`, `Toolbar`, `ToolIcon`, `DrawingController`, and `createDrawing` are exported for custom layouts. The drawing engine exports (`PENS`, `getStroke`, `strokePath`, serialization helpers, types, and palettes) match the original package.

## Keyboard

Every pen has the same single-key shortcut shown in its tooltip. `E` selects the eraser, `[` and `]` adjust size, and `⌘Z` / `⇧⌘Z` undo and redo. Hold `Shift` while drawing to constrain the stroke to the nearest of eight directions.
